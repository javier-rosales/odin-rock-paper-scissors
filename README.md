# Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project
The purpose of this project is to recreate one of the games that you probably know, **Rock Paper Scissors**, but, this time, in a webpage.

This project has been divided in two parts:

1. In the first part, there's no UI, the game works, but using browser functionalities (e.g., `prompt()`) and the JavaScript console.
2. In the second part, once I learned DOM manipulation, the UI was created, it's important to mention that (for now) the webpage is not responsive (i.e., It's not optimized for mobiles). Therefore the best way to use the webpage is on PC.
